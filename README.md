Executive Summary

Our goal is to create an extensible software implementation of the classic game of Battleship.

The game of Battleship is a classic board game popular among people around the world. However, there are additional features that people may enjoy, such as different CPU difficulties, online PVP, and additional play modes such as 3+ person multiplayer. The board game version is limiting in this regard, and players are also limited to playing with those they can physically interact with.

Our version of Battleship aims to improve on the physical Battleship board game and allow players to easily play together for free, on their computers.
